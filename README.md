## COVID-19-Data-Exploration-with-MySQL Workbench: 

In this project we conducted an exploratory analysis of the global impact of COVID-19 Deaths and Vaccinations in the population using MySQL Workbench.

## Resources

- Data Source: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths


## Queried Aspects: 

- Total Cases vs Total Deaths
- Total Cases vs Population
- Country with highest proportion of population infected
- Countries with highest death count per population
- Global Numbers showing death percentage by date and without date 
- Continents with highest number of deaths
- Total Population vs Vaccinations: Percentage of population that has received at least 1 dose of vaccine


## Concepts used
